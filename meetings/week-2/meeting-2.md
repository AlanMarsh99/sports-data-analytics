## Key Discussions:

- **Survey:**
  - We should do a survey, show different images of visualisations and dashboards of F1 and ask what they would want to see in the system. Which one they are more interested. Ask to F1 fans and F1 journalists. Every week we could get feedback from users. In the presentations show lots of visuals.

- **Data analysis:**
  - Multivariate data analysis. Demonstrate that our project is complex enough about data analysis. Collect different types of data, we will be open as much as possible to get data. Summary all the races per year, show heatmap and graphs. Different teams, weather, different races, telemetric data. Search F1 telemetric data analysis, and ask for the data used in different research papers. Predictive analysis: How different drivers react to each other, predict winner/podium, how tire strategy and weather affect.
